In Nigeria, reports from the national survey showed that cataract accounted for 43% of blindness and 45.3% of severe visual impairment. This project, which is focused on object
detection was built to enable Nigerian citizens, especially those in the rural area to detect early and mature stages of cataract. This will ensure early detection and commencement possible treatment.
